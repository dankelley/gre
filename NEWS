INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEBUGGING YOUR PROGRAM
       1.     Link with libefence.a as explained above.

       2.     Run your program in a debugger and fix any overruns or  accesses
              to free memory.

       3.     Quit the debugger.

       4.     Set EF_PROTECT_BELOW = 1 in the shell environment.

       5.     Repeat step 2, this time repairing underruns if they occur.

       6.     Quit the debugger.

       7.     Read the restrictions in the section on WORD-ALIGNMENT AND OVER-
              RUN DETECTION.  See if you can set EF_ALIGNMENT to 0 and  repeat
              step  2.  Sometimes this will be too much work, or there will be
              problems with library routines for  which  you  donâ€™t  have  the
              source, that will prevent you from doing this.

	* Segfaults when initializing variables.  It started doing this
	without code change, so it's likely a change in the
	compiler/library (most likely STL).  Lots of debugging stuff has
	been inserted.  Has STL changed a bit?  This bug seems to be
	relating to the <vector> holding variables.

	* I decided, while I'm working on the code anyway, to change this
	to use automake.  That way, I won't have to worry so much about
	dependencies while I am tweaking code.
